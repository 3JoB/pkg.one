# Fair Use Terms

## 1. Start
1. PKG.ONE is a free service provided by its owners and not much else.
2. Communication between PKG.ONE and users will be conducted on GitHub in the form of Issues.

## 2. Availability

PKG.ONE is designed to ensure continued availability of subdomain services. There is no right to continued availability. All services related to this free service will be provided on a voluntary basis. Users do not acquire ownership or other rights in individual services, registered subdomains and the entire service.

If the User violates the Terms, PKG.ONE reserves the right to exclude the User from the Service without notice and to subject the User to damages and other claims. PKG.ONE reserves the right to terminate or modify the Service at any time without notice or explanation. In such event, users of PKG.ONE will be notified promptly, at least 7 days in advance by PKG.ONE. Relevant information about impending use and deletion is simultaneously displayed to relevant users.

## 3. Termination
1. Both parties may terminate at any time without giving any reason.
2. The user cancels the service by deleting the CNAME file in their repository and raising issues in the PKG.ONE repository.
3. PKG.ONE may also terminate the provision of one or all subdomains. Relevant users will be notified at least 7 days in advance.

## 4 Rights and obligations
Transferring GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages and their PKG.ONE subdomain is allowed as long as the fair use terms are accepted. Users obtain from PKG.ONE a non-exclusive right to use the Service. The license expires upon cancellation of the agreement.

Users are solely responsible for the content provided by their GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages and are responsible for releasing PKG.ONE from all third-party claims. Users undertake not to transmit any material that infringes the rights of others or violates legal provisions.

In particular, the following content is prohibited:

- Piracy (software, videos, MP3s, DVDs, software, etc.)
- Phishing, Scam, Malware, Virus
- Piracy
- Questionable business model

- Content that leads to criminal behavior or acts that disrupt public order, or that otherwise violates national or international law
- All political behavior
- Sexual content or content intended for adults only

- Websites containing other illegal content

These are based on the premise that the website is a documentation website for an open source project. When the website type changes, or it is not a documentation website for an open source project from the beginning, it will be locked and canceled immediately.


Violation of these rules will result in immediate locking and cancellation of the PKG.ONE domain.

Users are obliged to publish a legal post on their website that contains at least their full name, postal address and e-mail address.
